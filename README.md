# Research_Project-Age-Related-Diseases-
Msc Bioinformatics Dissertation - Predicting and understanding future risk of age-related diseases using computational and machine learning approaches on multi-omics and lifestyle factors

## Project Summary
This project explores the use of machine learning models to predict the risk of 68 age-related diseases using multi-omics and lifestyle data.

## Structure
- `R/`: Scripts used for data cleaning and exploration
- `python/`: ML modeling scripts
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter
- `jobscripts/`: HPC job scripts

## How to Reproduce
Clone the repo and run individual scripts from R or Python as needed. Use provided job scripts for HPC execution if applicable.
